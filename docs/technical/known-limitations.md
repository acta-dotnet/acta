# Known limitations

## Purpose

Known boundaries to review before using Acta in production-like environments.

## Preview status

Acta is an early preview. APIs and behavior may change without deprecation until stability is
declared. The migration history freezes at 1.0.0 and not before: until then the schema baseline
(`M001`) may be re-cut in any release, and from 1.0.0 schema changes ship only as additive `Mnnn`
migrations. During the preview, upgrade compatibility between preview builds is not promised; a
schema-incompatible preview update means reprovisioning the Acta database. Bootstrap compares the
baseline stamp recorded in the database against the one this build ships and refuses to start on a
mismatch, so a stale database fails loudly instead of taking a schema it was not built for.
preview event/reason ids and other renumbered code values are intentionally incompatible; there is no
translation migration.

## Execution model

Acta jobs are at-least-once. A handler can run more than once after a crash, completion-write
failure, lease expiry, retry, or worker shutdown before completion is recorded.

Administrative actions can also make work run again. An operator restart deliberately re-arms a
job, and a database restore can rewind Acta state to a point where work appears runnable even if
external side effects already happened.

Acta does not provide deterministic workflow replay. The model is checkpoints, not replay: durable
slots record completed work and return stored results on re-entry, but the handler can re-enter from
the top.

No durable executor can guarantee exactly-once effects against arbitrary external systems. Acta gives
you at-least-once jobs, checkpointed durable steps, deduplication keys, and `AtMostOnce()` step
semantics; the application still owns external side-effect safety.

`AtMostOnce()` is for selected step bodies where duplicate execution is worse than an ambiguous
outcome. If the worker dies after Acta records the step start but before recording the outcome,
replay does not run the body again and the handler must reconcile whether the external side effect
happened.

The application owns side-effect safety. External systems such as payment providers, email
providers, webhooks, object storage, and partner APIs need deduplication keys, `AtMostOnce()`
placement, or reconciliation paths.

`Bulk` has relaxed completion durability. A crash can lose unflushed completion records and recovery
can re-run handler work that already finished in process. Use `Bulk` only for idempotent or safely
repeatable work.

## Contract evolution

Contract evolution requires discipline. Jobs are durable rows, and old rows may execute after a new
deploy. Keep the same job name only when old stored payloads still deserialize and run correctly;
use versioned job names for incompatible changes.

Acta's contract drift guard is not a full JSON schema compatibility checker. It catches
definition-level input/output type and payload-format changes; the application owns JSON wire
compatibility.

See [`contract-evolution.md`](../guide/contract-evolution.md).

## Dashboard and API exposure

Dashboard auth is the host application's responsibility. Acta ships no login system.

The dashboard and JSON API are local-only by default, and controls are disabled by default. Remote
exposure requires `LocalOnly = false` plus host authorization through `ConfigureEndpoints`; mapping
without either throws at startup unless `UnsafeAllowAnonymousRemoteAccess = true` is set explicitly.

Behind a reverse proxy on the same host, do not rely on `LocalOnly`; use real authorization.

## Storage and providers

SQLite has concurrency limits compared with server databases. Use SQL Server or PostgreSQL for
distributed multi-worker deployments.

SQL provider behavior should be tested under your workload, including claim pressure, long-running
handlers, retries, schedule load, alert delivery, retention sweeps, and backup/restore drills.

Large or sensitive payloads should live outside Acta tables. Store a reference in the job input and
keep the body in blob/file/object storage.

## Category boundaries

Acta is not a message bus. It does not provide a general-purpose transport abstraction, pub/sub
fabric, topic model, or Kafka-style streaming.

Acta is not a workflow SaaS. It does not provide a hosted orchestration control plane, login system,
tenant-admin product surface, BPMN, or visual workflow modeling.

Acta is not a streaming platform. It records durable job lifecycle and operator state; it is not
for ordered event streams, consumer groups, retention topics, or replaying high-volume logs.
